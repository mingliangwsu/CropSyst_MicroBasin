
Roger Nelson's date module.


Purpose

   This module provides a date class.

Features

   - This date class can use the

   - The class uses a novel approach for specifying the format of the text
     representation, that allows the date to be output in almost any imaginable
     format.

   - This date class properly handles all leap years.

   - Other date classes are limited to some arbitrary date.

   - The date value is stored as a long integer.
     The long integer representation used makes examining the
     date value with a debugger very easy since the year
     is simply the integer portion of the date value divided by
     1000 and the day of year is the date value modulo 1000
     I.e.  1990001 is January 1, 1990.

   - Date arithmetic if simple and efficient.

Limitations

   - The date class is similar to other date classes such as the
     Borland date class, but is not call compatible.

   - This date class, doesn't support true Julian date.

   - This date class does not account for the 15 days lost when
     the modern calendar was corrected by Pope Urban.

   - This date class doesn't support time (Hours/minus/seconds).
     Another class for time is envisioned.
     A separate class derived from the date and time class would
     be used for date and time as a single unit.

   - This class is intended for any OS, but currenlty the
     function computers_date() is defined only for MS-DOS/Windows.
     I do have the info to implement this function for
     AmigaDOS and UNIX, but just haven't gotten around to it.

Required modules

   Standard C libraries  math, stdio, and string.

Optional modules

   language.c language.h  (Roger Nelson's)

      This module provides foreign language translation and/or message
      cataloging for optimal memory usage.

      Inorder to use translations, #define LANGUAGE_TRANSLATION

      Under Borland C++ set the language.c compile attributes to C++ compile.

   cstring.h   (Borland C++)

      Required only to use the text_string() function.
      Will automatically be use if compiled under Borland C++.

Other

   A Pascal version version is also available.
   A C version is also available, but that version
     is considered obsolete and does not have as many
     feature as the C++ version.

   The date library is used by Roger Nelson's date requestor
   class for Borlands OWL base applications.
