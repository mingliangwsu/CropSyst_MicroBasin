
This was prompted by a question in alt.agriculture.misc about what
a chain is.  I found the information along with all of these other
measures.  Some of you may be interested in some of the equivalents
depending on what you aspire.

Length, surface, surveyor's, cubic, dry, liquid, troy, and
Apothecaries' measures.


TABLES OF LENGTH, AREA, VOLUME, AND WEIGHT

Measure of Length
4 inches = 1 hand

5280 feet - 1760 yards - 320 rods = 1 mile
3 miles = 1 league
