/*
There may be multiple progress-indicator type options,

*/
/* progress-frequency indicates how often the progress indicator is updated.
The larger the number, the greater the frequency.
The interpretation of the frequency is application specific.
Typically it would be one of the following:
- The number of items processed or main loop iterations.
- Real world run time
- Simulated time

This could be a level or time interval however the program wishes to interpret.
0 = no progress indicates no program during run
   (although always show indicator at end)
Typically the value (between 0 and 255) is run time

For simulation models
1 = show progress at yearly time steps
2 = show progress at daily time steps

*/
/* progress-units specifies the units to interpret the frequency.
The units are standard UED units code such as second, or minute or hour.
The default units would be (count main loop iterations such as items processed)

The progress_units argument could be omitted if the units are
concatenated with the progress-frequency number
I.e.
--progress-frequency=10s   would be every 10 seconds
--progress-frequency=20%   would be every 20 percent of completion
