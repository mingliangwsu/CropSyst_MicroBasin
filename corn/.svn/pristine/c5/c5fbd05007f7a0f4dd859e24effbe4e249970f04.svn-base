
Roger Nelson's valid type module.

Purpose

   This class can be used to help insure that float and int
   values stay within a specified warning or error range.


   These classes can be used to valididate a user's input.
   The class is intended to be used to perform a batch validation.
   For example the program could prompt the use for a set
   of input values then perform a validate on all of them, I.e:

   // prompt for values x,y,z
   valid_float v_x(x,0,PIC3,3,0.0,-100.0,100.0,-1000.0,1000.0,"m","Length");
   valid_float v_y(x,0,PIC3,3,0.0,-100.0,100.0,-1000.0,1000.0,"m","Width");
   valid_float v_z(x,0,PIC3,3,0.0,-100.0,100.0,-1000.0,1000.0,"m","Breadth");

   bool all_valid =
      v_x.validate(cerr) && v_y.validate(cerr) && v_z.validate(cerr);

   Although batch processing is generally how this class is used,
   it can also be used to validate individual entries as is done
   by my valid_intger_edit and valid_float_edit ROWL classes.

Features

   - The class can optionally support translation of error messages
     into foreign languages.

   - For validation of  int long and float

Limitations

   - double type not currently supported.

   - validation error/warning message should go to any kind of
     output string including strstream, but this has not been checked.

Required modules

   This module uses the new ANSI type  bool.
   If your C++ compiler doesn't define bool, then include first rlib/types.h

Optional modules

   language.c language.h  (Roger Nelson's)

      This module provides foreign language translation and/or message
      cataloging for optimal memory usage.

      Inorder to use translations, #define LANGUAGE_TRANSLATION

      Under Borland C++ set the language.c compile attributes to C++ compile.

Other

   These classes are used by my ROWL integer and floating point
   edit validators.

   These classes are used by my RLIB INI file class for
   validatation and annotation of INI files.
