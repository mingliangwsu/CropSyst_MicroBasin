These files are created with neither Excel 2003 nor Excel 2007.

These files are in the Microsoft Excel BIFF format as documented in 
Microsoft Excel 97 Developer's Kit by MicroSoft Press 1997 
is an OLD Excel format which predates both these versions of Excel.

The files I am working with are actually from a version of the BIFF5 
format that predates Excel 97.  
The data in the files consists of a single spreadsheet 
(this format predates workbooks)

We have been using these files in this format for over 15 years 
and all versions of Excel have read this legacy format of these files; 
indeed, both Excel 2003 and Excel 2007 read this format correctly, 
but with the patches installed, the spreadsheet is not displayed correctly.

An example of the file which is not displayed correctly is available at the following URL:

http://www.bsyse.wsu.edu/rnelson/temp/annual.xls

If you open this file with Excel 2007 a workbook/spreadsheet window opens 
(There is no error message), but only the window frame is shown with scroll bars, 
maximize, minimize, close buttons. The window title shows the file name   
annual.xls [Compatibility Mode]  The inside area of the window shows only  
the blue background color. No cell grid, no data and no cell row/column numbers are displayed.  
When I press the keyboard arrow keys, a black box is displayed 
in the window area where a cell would be if it were displayed correctly. 
I can move this cell 'cursor' around the window using the arrow keys, 
and the data from the cell is displayed in the data/formula input field. 

If I click /View\ [New Window], I do then see the spreadsheet and the data 
is displayed correctly in the new window. 

When I unistall the patch, the spreadsheet opens and all the data is displayed 
immediately correctly in the spreadsheet window.  
So Excel, with the patch installed, is reading all the file's data, 
it just isn't displaying the window correctly.  

This problem occurs not only on my computer but also all my collegues' 
computers where the respective Excel2003 or Excel 2007 patches 
have been installed either under Vista or XP. It appears to be a bug 
introduced and common to both patch(s).

These files are used by hundereds of scientist and researchers in dozens of 
countries around the world. So I am hoping the display problem can be fixed.


I suspect that the security updates
 KB936507  and KB936509 
when openning the workbook/spreadsheet are looking for 
or referencing format/display information in a BIFF record that did not exist
in the previous/earlier formats, or, is not 
using information from older version of BIFF records.
 
I think I have narrowed down the problem to the Excel's processing
of the   WINDOW2 BIFF in the XLS BIFF record file stream.
 
Note that there are TWO versions of the WINDOW2 BIFF record in the Excel file format specification.
BIFF record header code 3E (hex), (compatible with BIFF versions prior to BIFF8.
and BIFF header code 23E (hex) used in BIFF8 and later
(As documented on page 422 and 423 of  MicroSoft Excel 97 Developers Kit (1997)).
 
The format of my annual.XLS file uses the the older 3E (hex) version.
(I have written a program that dumps the BIFF records header codes of .XLS files)
My annual.XLS file uses only the following BIFF record types:
 
0002h INTEGER cell
0003h NUMBER cell
0004h LABEL cell
000Ah EOF
003Dh WINDOW1
003Eh WINDOW2
0041h PANE
0200h DIMENSIONS
0809h BOF
 
(The WINDOW1, WINDOW2 and PANE records occur near the end of the XLS file).
 
 
If I edit my annual.xls file with a binary file editor and zero out the two bytes of the 
WINDOW2 record body corresponding to the grbit field, and then open and view the file
in Excel (with the patch installed), 
the data is displayed; albeit as expected, without the desirable spreadsheet display elements, grid lines and row/col numbers.
 
 
[ In my annual.xls file I provided you with in my previous email (http://www.bsyse.wsu.edu/rnelson/temp/annual.xls),
 the first byte of the grbit field is at file position  0000165D (hexidecimal)  5725 (decimal)
The flagged option for this field are set for:
 
display formula (disabled)
display grid      (enabled)
display row/col (enabled)
frozen              (enabled)
display zeros   (enabled)
default header  (disabled)
arabic              (disabled)
display guts     (disabled)
frozen no split  (enabled)
sheet selected (enabled)
paged             (enabled)
reserved bits   (cleared)
 
Here is a version of this same file where I have cleared (to 0) both bytes 
the grbit field of the WINDOW2 record with a binary file editor:
http://www.bsyse.wsu.edu/rnelson/temp/annual_grbit_cleared.xls
]
 
Excel is very sensitive to the settings of the option flags of the WINDOW2 BIFF record (named 'grbit' at record offset 4),
with regards to correct display of the spreadsheet window.
For example: if I set the grbit field to different values,
to display only the grid, or only the row/col, it may display part of the data, but columns may be missing,
or extra columns may be inserted or other messed up display artifacts.
 
This would imply that the older version of the WINDOW2 record (BIFF code 3E (hex)) 
is being read, but the display options are not being processed correctly for the window display.
 
Another less likely explaination:
 
Perhaps your Excel programmer when making modifications in this update, 
is using the newer WINDOW2 record (BIFF code 23E (hex)) and forgot about
the older version of the WINDOW2 record (BIFF code 3E (hex)) which  occurs in older formats.
 
I can see how, if the 3E (hex) record is not processed, the window will not be displayed correctly.
This would explain why when I use /View\[New window] the data is then displayed correctly:
because, the new window is most likely created with the newer WINDOW2 code 23E (hex).
 
I can see how a programmer could be easily confused with these two 
versions of the WINDOW2 record 
and how the older could have been inadvertantly disregarded.
(These records probably should not have been given the same name).
 
Perhaps this part of the program was refactored and the 
older WINDOW2 record type was omitted.
 
 
In any case the problem appears to be the display of the window as a result
of improper interpretation of the grbit field of the WINDOW2 'Sheet Window Information Record'
BIFF record code 3E (hex), for BIFF 7 or earlier formats.  
This is most likely in the 'compatibility mode' part of the Excel source code.
