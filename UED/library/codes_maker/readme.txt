This simple utility outputs standard codes.

It should be recompiled and run whenever standard codes
are added to UED.

It is used for Weather database UED record creators.
I used to use the UED::STD_VC_XXXX.get() methods 
to get the variable code (the preferable option)
but the compiler is not guarenteeing that 
UED::STD_VC_XXXX are being updated correctly
