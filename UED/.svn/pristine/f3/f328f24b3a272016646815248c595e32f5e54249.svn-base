Enable macros and press [Alt][F11] to open up VBA macro editor.
Click on "Microsoft Excel Objects" and "sheet1"
<P>
You should be able to see how to call the functions from
the comments in the VB example.
<P>
In the spreadsheet, the [Start] button will load the data from the UED file to the spreadsheet.
(Note that the sample file only has precip, and temperature,
so this is all the example will add to the spreadsheet.)
<P>
Note that you will need to put the .DLL file in some common directory in your PATH accessible to Excel
(I.e. c:\windows\system32 directory)
<P>
Refer to the notes in the UED_simple.bas file for how to use the dll in Excel Visual Basic for applications.
For Visual Basic, the process is much the same, and I would presume so also for SQL server using Visual Basic for Applications.
<P>
You may need to redo the steps to import the .BAS files into the spreadsheet, I'm not sure.
<P>
Another note on using the DLL with Visual Basic: you must pass a string variable to the UED_simple_open() function,
you cannot use a literal constant.  (See the sample spreadsheet macro by pressing [Alt][F11])
<P>
A .H file is available for C or C++ (instructions for using the dll with C and C++ are in this file).
(UED_simple.bas is the same as UED_simple.h in Visual Basic).
<P>
Currently the file UED_codes only has the units codes (UC_xxx) for units used by ClimGen,
the UED_simple_get_xxxx() function can actually perform units conversions for all possible relevant metric
units,  I.e.  mm, cm, d, m, Dm, hm, km, etc.. and most equivalent English units.
<P>
If you are using C++ I can send you the units code header file which will give you all the available units codes.

<P>
For Visual basic, if you want some other units let me know and I will add the codes to the UED_Codes.bas file.
<BR>
(I didn't list all the codes for all the units since it would take me hours to prepare, but I can easily add any individual units you need).
<P>
The UED_codes.bas file lists standard UED codes.
<BR>
Only the codes precipitation, temperature, solar rad, relative humidity,
dew pt temperatures and wind speed are currently used by ClimGen.
<BR>
(ClimGen may also generate some of the ET and VPD variables
(depending on available data)).
