Operation selection #1
Terminate crop  (end growth without a harvested yield) #2
Dust mulching #3
Mulching layer depth #5
This is the number of days the mulch layer tends to remain sand like (with no precipitation) #7
Number of days until mulch effect subsides #8
0.0 = not effect, 1.0 most sever (actually don''t use 1.0) #10
Dust mulch intensity #11
NRCS field operation #13
Used for surface residue disturbance and fate #14
The higher the numbers, the greater the cumulative soil disturbance. Ultimately this is intended to affect organic matter decomposition. #156
Tillage intensity oxidation effect #157
