
Crop parameter file syntax has the basic form
similar to .INI files with sections.


consider using  libconfig  
http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/libconfig_manual.html#Why-Another-Configuration-File-Library_003f
(this appears to allow user extended syntax


<P>
[<em>section name</em>]
<P>
 and variable value pairs
<P>
<em>variable</em>=<em>value</em>  <em>units</em>
<P>

<H3>Interpolation curves</H3>

Over the years it has been found that some parameters need to be adjusted during the growing season
by stepped interpolation (as the crop enters a phenologic growth stage)
or by interpolation (thermal time basis) .
Currently linear interpolation (eventually curvilinear (spline?) interpolation may be supported)
In this case the variable in a section will have a subsection denoted by <B> ( ) </B>.
<P>
<PRE>
<B>(</B><em>variable name</em><B>)</B>
<B>value=</B><em>value</em>
<B>units=</B><em>units</em>
<B>curve=</B><B>constant</B> <em> or </em> <B>linear</B>  <FONT color="gray"> <em>or</em> <B>spline</B> </FONT>
</PRE>
The value for the parameter will be initialized to the specified value.
<UL>
<LI>
In the case of the constant curve option, the value and will persist until the 
the next point on the curve is encountered.
<LI>
In the case of linear option, the current values will be linearly interpolated.
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="GRAY">
Not yet implemented: In the case of spline the current values will be interpolated 
curvilinearly using a spline function.
</FONT>
</UL>

<H3>Optional parameter sets</H3>

For selected simulation submodel options specified by some variable value pair 
(usually in the current section, but may be another section such as the common [crop] section)
there is often a  set of parameters specific to a submodel or otherwise optional
these are stored in a subsection denoted  by  <B> < > </B>
<P>

<B> < </B> <em>option</em><B>=</B><em>value-1 value-n</em> <B> > </B>
<P>
The section specifies which of the options the following variables are applicable to.
<P>
All the parameters for all the optional subsections,
this will allow the user to switch between submodel options without having to 
reenter all the values when switching back.
