Dormancy/Seasonal #451
Single season #452
This mode is has no additional parameters and the crop tends to remain in maturity until harvest. #453
This mode is most commonly used for annual, biennial or (sometimes) perennial crops that are not allowed to (or cannot) grow to a second season.  This mode is also usually used for winter crops. #454
Multiple season #455
Plants may go into a state of inactivity (but not necessarily dormancy) that typifies the end of the season. #456

Senescence #490
For "shed" mode, after dormancy, senesced biomass (from the previous season) sloughs of immediately.  Biomass produced during the current season is retained until dormancy. #491
Lingers mode may be needed for perennials (I.e. grasses) where senesced biomass (typically leaf and stem) remains ''on'' the plant before falling off and becoming decomposing residue. #492

Endures - Senesced biomass is retained on the plant as long as it is alive (annuals and some perennials). #495
