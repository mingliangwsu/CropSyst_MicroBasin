Conditions that force clipping/harvest #2
Any of the following enabled conditions may trigger the clipping/grazing/harvest event (these conditions are ''or'' not ''and'' I.e.  consider growth rate or consider LAI or consider Biomass or consider flowering.). #3
This growth rate adjustment accelerates (above 1) or delays clipping (below 1) and it is used as a multiplier to what is considered a low green area index growth rate, which is a fixed value embedded in the code (0.05 GAI/day).  #4
Relative growth rate adjustement #5
Maximum biomass that forces clipping #7
Maximum LAI that forces clipping #9
This is usually used with alfalfa to clip as the plants flower or reflower #11
Number of days after flowering forces clippingDays #12
Consider relative growth rate adjustement #13
Clip when LAI is reached #14
Consider LAI status #15
Clip when biomass is reached #16
Consider Biomass status #17
Clip based on flowering #18
Consider flowering status #19
Operation constraints and biomatter fate #20
