
<H2>Cladistic files</H2>

Often similar crops have the same parameters
usually corresponding to their phylogenetics.
<P>
The CropSyst crop parameter files can be organized
in a cladistic  specialization structure using directory trees.
(Currently assuming only a monophyletic like deriviation). 
<P>
There may be any number of cladic deriviations
but usually there were only be 2 or three that a user will be storing/working with
which would roughly correspond to  species/variety and cultivar, but could potentially 
be a full  phylogenetic derivation of a prefered phylogenetic or taxanomic cladistic system.
<P>
Crop parameters are stored in tree structures generally a directory in the file system.  
A directory distinquishes a clade.
Files in a directory define the clade. These will include a parameter file
and additional documents, images, notes, version, etc.. 
<P>
Subdirectories would denote derivative clades.
<P>
Parameter files in a clade store  only those parameters that are different
from the parent (basal) clade.  So parameters are loaded first from the 
parameter file in uppermost basel (ancestor) clad listed in the corresponding 
qualified directory name path, then the next directory in the path, 
and so on insequence until the most specialize clade parameter file in the path 
(directory tree leaf) is loaded.
The parameters specified in the more specialized clade parameter files override any parameters 
that may exist in the parent clade parameter files as the are loaded in this prescribed sequence.
<P>

For example one might have a cladistic directory structure such as
<PRE>
Poaceae\Triticeae\Triticum\aestivum\Durum\Stanton
Poaceae\Pooideae\Aveneae\Avena\sativa
</PRE>

<H3>Cladistic derivation in a single file (optional, conceptual)</H3>

It is not necessary to use the cladistic directory structure,
one can have a single file specifying all parameters for a crop cultivar.
Sections denoted by { <em>clade name</em> } distinquish a clade name.
<P>

If using cladistic derivations sometimes it may be convenient to store a complete a clade deriviation line 
in a single file this is done by having sections denoted by  the symbols {}.
So, the cladistic form of the Crop Parameter files is an optional extension of 
the basic crop parameter file.
Listed in the order of deriviation for example, if one were using the phylogenetic 
system, the file for a specific cultivar of winter wheat might look something like this.
