<H1>Observation</H1>

Observation is a set of classes that allows variables to be
inspected, examined, recorded and processed
independent of the simulation model
with minimal impact on the simulation model and submodels objects.

<H2>Inspector (scalar)</H2>

The inspector can be used to:
<UL>
<LI>Record variable values for output.
<LI>Communicate between disparate modules such as pluggins
    that may not even be implemented in the same language.
</UL> 
 <P>
 
Any object may add inspectors.
Inspectors could be added at any time, but by adding
during (initialization) this will ensure that the inspectors
are known when any periods are added (to examination).
<P>
Typically inspector is given to the examination_global to maintain.
<P>
Conceptual:<BR>
There may be other cases where an object would like to 
have a private list of inspectors.
<P>
An object simply creates an emanator object which it gives
to the global emanator list and implements a method
that instanciates inspectors and gives the inspectors to the
provided list of inspectors.
The Object usually no longer interacts with the inspector it creates.
Simulation elements that exist throughout the duration of the simulation
need not maintain references to their inspectors nor emanators.
<P>
An object which may go out of scope (be deleted) will usually keep
a reference to its emanator so that in the destructor 
it can signal the emanator that it is being deleted.
Inspectors use this to know that the inspected value reference no longer
exists for the deleted emanating object.

<P>
The simulation engine initiates the global inspection mechanism
Typically at the end of it's start() method,
this allows subelements to have been instanciated, initialized
and started .
<FONT color="gray">
{May want to start the inspection before starting 
anything else (subelements)}
</FONT>
<P>
A subelement may be dynamic, instanciated after global inspection has been setup.
The element instanciating a subelement may initiate inspector rendition
to allow the subelement to add its emanator and inspectors.
<P>
An element will typically add inspectors for all variables suitable
for inspection.  The application (which instantiates the the simulation engine).
may provide mechanism to 'prune' the global inspector list removing inspectors
that are of no interest.  Of shunt inspectors from the global 'active'
list to inactive lists (I.e. to temporarily disable specific inspections).
<P>
Simulation elements can create their own Inspections
and or interactive with the global inspection as they may have knowledge
about the relevence of inspection.

The strata mechanism has some additional overhead
Most of the processing could be perform outside of the

<H2>Inspection</H2>

Inspection is a mechanism that allows variables to be observed.


<H2>Examination</H2.


Examination is a mechanism that allows observations to be tallied and/or recorded.


<H2>Recorder</H2>

Examinations can be recorded to files is various formats using a recorder
where the recorder outputs the Inspector  values to a file
in the specific format.
<P>
Typically there would be a subdirectory for each simulation element.
For the overall simulation scenario which is derived from 
Simulation_engine where
the scenario directory is typically the current working (scenario) directory.
<P>
Output can optionally  be written directly into the scenario directory
or an "Output" directory:

  <LI>In CS Suite V5 with its new emphasis on scenario 
      level directory generation, everything in the directory

</TABLE>
<P>

The target directory is not specifically identified
as the scenario directory name is the name of the scenario.
<P>
Subdirectories (under the target) are created for emanating subobjects.
These may be specifically identified by the user 
(for example crop outputs are written in a directory
 whose name matches the crop parameter file name),
or the emanating class may specify a fixed name.

<DT><H4>Statistical tally</H4>

Tallies are provided as a convenience.
Although the model could easily output all the detailed data
to be tallied externally, this could add significantly to the amount of output
where the user would most likely be making summaries anyway.
Using tallies, significantly reduces the amount of unecessary output.
but may increase slightly memory requirements and there may
be some computational overhead.
Although there is computational overhead, since only the tallied
values are written there is significant reduction in over all run time.
Each variable is coded to indicate the statistical tally.
