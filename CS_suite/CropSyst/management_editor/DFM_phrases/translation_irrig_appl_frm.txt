Irrigation application #1
Application conditions #2
Application conditions only apply to automatic irrigation or periodic specified events #3
Typically ''Soil water depletion'' mode is used. Leaf water potential mode is intended for fruit orchard/vineyard. #4
Consideration mode #5
Soil water depletion #6
Leaf water potential #7
Depletion constraints #8
Maximum allowable depletion #9
Usually use a value 1 or less. Greater than 1 will evaluate deeper than the roots. #11
Fraction of current root depth #12
Depletion observation depth #14
These options can be set because this event has postponable contigency. #16
Observation depth mode #17
at a constant fixed depth #18
at a fraction of the current root depth #19
the entire profile #20
Irrigation will occur when the leaf water potential becomes more negative than this value. #21
Leaf water potential #22
Application amount #24
If this operation is schedule to repeat, the "Irrigate to a specified refill point" (based on soil conditions) may be useful.  If this is a single event, simply use "Irrigate a fixed amount". #25
Application mode #26
Irrigate a fixed amount #27
Irrigate to a specified refill point #28
Enter 0.0 to supply enough water to refill to plant available water #29
Total irrigation #30
This parameter is used to add a little more irrigation to compensate for inefficiency.  (Values > 1.0 are less efficient) #32
Net irrigation multiplier (1.0 is 100% efficient) #33
This can be used to fix an upper limit a recharging option is specified (Enter 0.0 if no maximum is applied) #35
Irrigation system maximum application capacitymm #36
This can be used to specify the minimum amount of water the irrigation system can deliver (Enter 0.0 if no maximum is applied) #37
Irrigation system minimum application capability #38
This is the fraction of plant available water to refill to (0=permanent wilt point, 1=field capacity) #40
Refill point #41
Solute concentrations #43
Enter 0 values for concentration if not applicable. #44
Salt concentration (Salinity) #45
Nitrate NO3 nitrogen concentration #47
Ammonium NH4 nitrogen concentration #49
